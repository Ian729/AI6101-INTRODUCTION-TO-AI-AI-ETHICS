Week 13 Lecture Video
Posted on: Monday, November 8, 2021 9:29:53 PM SGT

Dear all,

Week 13 lecture recording is online under Lecture Videos.

Due to network disruptions, today's lecture recording quality is not good. Therefore, I have uploaded the recording from the previous semester which is essentially the same.

This concludes our course for this semester. All the best!

Thank you

Best regards

Corrigendum + Reminder about AI6101 Essay Deadline
Posted on: Monday, November 8, 2021 3:40:33 PM SGT

Dear AI6101 students,

I hope that this message finds you well.

A couple of updates/reminders:
1) Corrigendum:
It has belatedly come to my attention that the subtotal for my AI6101 component should be 20% instead of 19%. Thank you Weixiang for the eagle-eyed spot! This entails that your Reading Tasks in Weeks 8 and 9 should each account for 2.5% rather than 2% of your overall AI6101 score. Here is the breakdown for my AI6101 component:

Week 8 Reading Tasks	2%       2.5%
Week 9 Reading Tasks	2%       2.5%
Take-home Essay	15%
SUBTOTAL	19%       20%

My humblest apologies for any inconvenience inadvertently caused by this error in publishing the Reading Task scores (although the new breakdown of scores does make my task of computing your scores from each of the 5-question tasks relatively more straightforward);

2) Reminder:
This is a gentle reminder that your AI6101 take-home essay will be due by 11.59 pm on 14 Nov. Kindly ensure that you submit your output via Turnitin before then. This required output is an open-ended mini-essay (no more than 1,000 words). Your bibliography will not be included in the word count. For more detailed guidance on conducting research and crafting an essay, do take a look at my 12 Oct announcement on NTULearn, the 'Research Tips' and 'Essay Guidelines' section of the 'AI6101 Take-Home Essay Question' pdf, and the 'Essay Guidelines' section of my Lecture 2 slides.

Last but not least and on a separate note, if you are curious about what might happen when ethical decision-making is outsourced to AI systems, then do take a look at this article: https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7dg8m/ethical-ai-trained-on-reddit-posts-said-genocide-is-okay-if-it-makes-people-happy?fbclid=IwAR0KqCU1W3MLj_kM8_eHW_KbsjGfCrBvjGoD0eE-l4KxGR_rIWmhR5ZMA_I

Take care, do continue to stay safe, healthy, and well, best of luck for the remainder of the academic semester, and I look forward to receiving your AI6101 take-home essay submissions.

With every good wish,
Melvin

AI6101 Lecture 2 (Week 9) Recordings + Take-home Essay
Posted on: Tuesday, October 12, 2021 11:28:05 AM SGT

Dear AI6101 students,

Here are a few important updates:
1) AI6101 Lecture 2 (Week 9) Recordings

The audio and video recordings for Lecture 2 (Week 9) are now available:
AI6101 Lecture 2 Zoom recording (Zoom Cloud): https://ntu-sg.zoom.us/rec/share/V95SXNrO1zKihi5pmriJuZRIwFtc8Eu5myiuDiD5Egj9_1dxjx2-4JVwcQe9RGkP.y6_POUe_PG8QJi-V
Password: 8wGoe6P#

AI6101 Lecture 2 Audio recording (Google Drive): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d4WcmJaWfp9qgL2e-Y75iFp1h-kR1X3A/view?usp=sharing

2) AI6101 Take-home Essay
My colleagues Bo An and Yu Han have kindly confirmed with me that there will be no formal examination component for this course. I am therefore at liberty to release the details for the AI6101 take-home essay and will do so with immediate effect. 

Here is the take-home essay question:
Moral philosophy is traditionally subdivided into metaethics, normative theory and applied ethics. What are the possible ethical standards that we find described in normative theory and how might they provide guidance on the AI research front?

Here are the take-home essay instructions:
This is an open-ended mini-essay (no more than 1,000 words). Your bibliography will not be included in the word count. I am happy to accept any of the following referencing styles: APA, MLA, Chicago, and Harvard.

The take-home essay should be submitted via the Turnitin portal on NTULearn by 11.59 pm on 14 Nov (Week 13). It will account for 15% of your overall AI6101 grade.

Here are some research tips:
a) Good databases that you may wish to explore for your research include (but are not limited to) the following:
NTU OneSearch: https://ntu-sp.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?vid=65NTU_INST:65NTU_INST
Google Scholar: https://scholar.google.com/
PhilPapers: https://philpapers.org/

b) Here is a useful resource on Boolean search and other database search tips, courtesy of MIT Libraries: https://libguides.mit.edu/c.php?g=175963p=1158594

c) In addition, here is a useful resource on referencing styles and conventions, courtesy of Purdue OWL: https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/purdue_owl.html

I have published a compilation (in pdf form) of the details about the essay question, instructions, research tips, and essay guidelines. This pdf may be accessed in the following manner on NTULearn:
21S1-AI6101-INTRODUCTION TO AI & AI ETHICS > Course Documents > Lecture Notes > Weeks 8 & 9 – The Philosophical Foundations of AI Ethics > AI6101 Take-home Essay (Turnitin)

The Turnitin portal for submission has also been activated. It may be accessed in the following manner on NTULearn:
21S1-AI6101-INTRODUCTION TO AI & AI ETHICS > Assignments > Take-home Essay (15%; Turnitin)

Last but not least, I have updated the AI6101 syllabus outline document w.r.t. the philosophical foundations of AI ethics to reflect the fact that the essay is a take-home essay rather than a final exam essay.

Thank you for having been such wonderful and engaging students, take care, do continue to stay safe and well, all the best for the remainder of the AI6101 course and your MSAI programme, and I look forward to reading your final submissions for the AI6101 essay.

With every good wish,
Melvin

AI6101 The Philosophical Foundations of AI Ethics - Week 9
Posted on: Monday, October 11, 2021 2:26:19 PM SGT

Dear AI6101 students,

I hope that you have had a restful and rewarding weekend.

Here is a set of updates and reminders:
1) We will be holding our second seminar on the philosophical foundations of AI ethics on Zoom this evening. 

Week 9 Zoom details:
Link: https://ntu-sg.zoom.us/j/97931610683

Date: 11 Oct
Time: 6.30-9.30 pm (Singapore time)
Meeting ID: 979 3161 0683
Passcode: 377651

2) The Week 9 Reading Tasks (2%) are now available on the NTULearn portal. This assignment has to be completed by 11.59 pm on 17 Oct (Sunday). Material from the Anscombe (1958) and Russell & Norvig (2010) readings will be covered in this assignment;

3) On a separate note and in case you might be interested, I have developed a new web-based resource on the different approaches to AI research. There is a chatbot program with which you can have a conversation. I have modified and adapted its js code from George Dunlop’s code for ELIZA. Note that the original script for ELIZA was written by Joseph Weizenbaum. The chatbot is the second AI program being hosted on my personal website: there is also a chess-playing AI program that may be found in my web-based resource on game-playing AI.

Take care, do continue to stay safe, healthy, and well, and see you on Zoom later this evening!

With every good wish,
Melvin

AI6101 The Philosophical Foundations of AI Ethics - Weeks 8 & 9
Posted on: Tuesday, September 28, 2021 10:32:42 AM SGT

Dear AI6101 students,

I hope that this message finds you safe and well.

Allow me to introduce myself: I am Dr. Melvin Chen and I shall be guiding you through the philosophical foundations of AI ethics in Weeks 8 and 9. My research interests include (but are not limited to) the philosophy of AI, causal epistemology, medical AI, normative ethics, and metaethics. Here is my personal website and here is a web-based resource that I have developed on game-playing AI systems. The web-based resource on game-playing AI systems even allows you to play chess and tic-tac-toe!

In addition, here are a few updates in advance of our fortnight-long foray into the philosophical foundations of AI ethics:
(1) NTULearn resources:
A number of course-relevant resources have been published on NTULearn. They may be accessed in the following manner:
21S1-AI6101-INTRODUCTION TO AI & AI ETHICS > COURSE DOCUMENTS > LECTURE NOTES > Weeks 8 & 9 - The Philosophical Foundations of AI Ethics

The AI6101 syllabus outline document, lectures, readings (required and supplementary), additional resources may be accessed therefrom. While a document containing COVID-19 regulations has also been included, it may be less relevant, given the latest slew of COVID-19 regulations (see also (2));

(2) Online seminars + Zoom details:
While the AI6101 seminars have hitherto been conducted in a hybrid mode at LT 7, I have been given to understand that a new recommendation has been made by the Associate Chair (Academic) of SCSE in favour of classes being moved online. The Multi-Ministry Taskforce in Singapore is currently trying to slow down community transmission of COVID-19 and minimize the strain on the healthcare capacity of Singapore. As I collaborate with medical professionals and clinicians in my medical AI research, I am acutely aware of the salience of the latter point. In line with the tightening safe management measures nationwide (27 Sep-24 Oct), NTU has adjusted its own safe management measures accordingly. You should have received a message from the NTU President's Office stating the aforementioned.

I am not a fan of the online mode of instruction but have decided in favour of heeding the recommendation that has been made by the Associate Chair (Academic) of SCSE. The Associate Chair (Academic) of my home school (SoH) has made the same recommendation. In lieu of the hybrid mode of instruction, we shall instead meet online. I will make an announcement if anything changes. For the moment, here are the Zoom details for our seminars in Weeks 8 and 9:

Week 8 Zoom details:
Link: https://ntu-sg.zoom.us/j/95847511280

Date: 4 Oct
Time: 6.30-9.30 pm (Singapore time)
Meeting ID: 958 4751 1280
Passcode: 177591

Week 9 Zoom details:
Link: https://ntu-sg.zoom.us/j/97931610683

Date: 11 Oct
Time: 6.30-9.30 pm (Singapore time)
Meeting ID: 979 3161 0683
Passcode: 377651

Take care, have a good Recess Week, and see you on Zoom on Oct 4!

With every good wish,
Melvin
